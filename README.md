# Math with Sympy

## Goal
After years of using the Python scientific stack, there is one package that I never really had the chance to try: sympy. In part because I didn't know how to use it and because I didn't really have an excuse to try it. In these notebooks I finally give the chance it deserved by solving all the questions from the book "Wiskunde in beweging" [^Theo]. This book contains all math you'll ever need as a human movement scientist and by solving the assignments I show that sympy is all you'll ever need to analytically solve equations relevant to the field.
